# MiniAV Project

## Setup

To setup the miniav cli, it is fairly simple. 

### Clone the repo

First, clone the miniav repo locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:uwsbel/miniav-cli.git
cd miniav-cli
```

### Install the miniav package


```bash
python setup.py install
```

_**Note: If you're planning on developing the package, you may wish to install it as symlinks:**_

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

### Test the demos

You should now be all set up!

You can test the installation by running the demos in `demos/`. They demonstrate the CLI and the python API.
