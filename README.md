# MiniAV Project

The MiniAV project is meant to be a testbed for automated driving algorithm development and is to be used as a mechanism for validating the simulation platform [Chrono](https://projectchrono.org). The MiniAV platform is under activate development by the [Simulation Based Engineering Laboratory](https://sbel.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu). 

## Background

The MiniAV platform provides the following resources for expediting development of autonomous algorithms:
1. A parts list and instructions on how to build the physical platform
2. A high-fidelity simulation environment built using [Chrono](https://projectchrono.org) to test autonomous algorithms
3. A development workflow for writing ROS 2 code and various already implemented algorithms
4. A database system to expedite data recording and parsing and an accompaning command line interface

For more information about the design considerations and purpose for this project, see the [background](https://projects.sbel.org/miniav/background.html) section.
