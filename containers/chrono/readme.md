# OptiX Install

You will need to save the OptiX 7.7 build file here in order for chrono to build properly. The file should have exactly the same name as when downloaded, which should be:

```
NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-7.7.0-linux64-x86_64.sh
```

You can [download OptiX 7.7 here](https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download).
